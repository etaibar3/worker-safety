To run you will need to have mongodb and npm downloaded globally on your computer. 
Also you will need install nodemon, which you can do after installing npm with the 
command "npm install -g nodemon".

To run boilerplate:
Run server - cd into server folder and run "npm run db" - leave this open in the background.
Run frontend code - in a new terminal window cd into client folder and and run "npm start".

You'll know it was successfull if it says
"server started
successfully connceted to database" in ternminal you ran surver in.
And if it opens a new web tab on http://localhost:3000 that displays react logo 
after running frontend.


The client folder was created using create-react-app.
The server folder just has an index.js file (like a main). We will need to add
sub directories in ./server to organize routes and schemas I think.
