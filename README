# Safe Return
## Description of the app:
Safe Return allows companies to track and manage desk reservations as employees return to the 
office after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Safe Return is built using MongoDB, neo4j database, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. 

## List of supported features:
Creating accounts - each account is linked to a company. A single admin creates an organization, 
and then they can add other admins and employees to that organization for account creation. 
There are two types of users - admins and employees. 

Floor plan creation - Admins can upload floor plan images and mark the locations of desk. The
second step of floor plan creation is setting the scale of the image. 

Desk reservations - Individual accounts (both admins and employees) can reserve a desk for
a specific day. Desk reservations must be 6 feet from one another. Safe Return keeps track
of where everyone has been sitting. 

Report a case - if someone reports a positive COVID-19 case, which they can do anonymously, 
other employees who sat near that person are notified via email that they may be at risk. 
This feature uses SendGrid to send emails automatically. 


## Future Improvements: 
Accouting for walls - desk that are in different rooms / separated by a wall can currently be 
viewed as too close to each other (within 6 feet) for a desk reservation. 

Attendance - giving the admin an overview of a specific day's desk reservations. 

Reserving multiple days - making group reservations for multiple days more convenient. 

Clarifying instructions - making a tutorial for creating a floor plan and setting the scale 
of the image

Multiple floors - having the ability to create multiple floor plans per organization

Confirming email - confirming the email of the first account created for security purposes

General security improvements - threat modeling session / captcha
